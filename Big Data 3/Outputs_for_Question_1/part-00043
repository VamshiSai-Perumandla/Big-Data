260	Cooked in this way--that is, if ripe--they may not only be preserved a great deal better, but they are richer, and more palatable; and what is of more consequence still, they are less liable to produce flatulence, and are more wholesome
	
	
261	--Take 1 quart of  flour,  4  eggs,  a piece of  butter  the size of an  egg,  a piece of  lard  the same size; mix the  butter  and  lard  well in the  flour;  beat the  eggs  light in a pint bowl, and fill it up with  cold milk;  then pour it gradually into the  flour;  add a tea-spoonful of  salt;  work it for 8 or 10 minutes only; cut the dough with a knife the size you wish it; roll them into cakes about the size of a breakfast-plate, and bake in a quick oven
